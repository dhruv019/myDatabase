# myDatabase
I've performed all the given tasks in a single myDatabase.java program. I've shown the program's output and the table created in MySQL server in myDatabase.docx file.

Brief explanation of my program: Registered the MySQL driver using the forname() method. Opened a connection to the database. Used executeQuery to fetch data from the database and used executeUpdate to make changes in the database. I've used standard statement to fetch all data (select * ) and used the prepareStatement for Select query with parameters and I've shown the output of these statements using ResultSet.
